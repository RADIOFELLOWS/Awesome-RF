## RADIOFELLOWS

**Our Vision**
We believe real progress in RF engineering happens when people freely share their ideas, circuit designs, and lessons learned—no hidden secrets or closed-door solutions. Our community thrives on transparency, collaboration, and respect for every contribution, whether it's a simple layout tweak or a brand-new amplifier concept. Our work is handicapped by paywalls and heavy licenses for conducting simpel tasks, and our antidote is community and software literacy. 

**Our Focus**
We specialize in practical, circuit-centered resources for RF engineers and enthusiasts. That means delving into topics like amplifier design, oscillator stability, low-noise PCB layouts, and RF front-end architectures. We’ll also review and improve existing open-source circuits out there, always looking for ways to refine performance or highlight best practices. We won’t dive into proprietary or closed firmware development—everything we do is aimed at being openly shared, tested, and improved.

**Our Purpose**
Our mission is to unite professionals, hobbyists, and curious newcomers around a shared passion for building better RF hardware. By offering easy-to-understand documentation, tested circuit examples, and a welcoming place to discuss challenges, we want to help everyone push the boundaries of what’s possible in RF. We’re here to spark ideas, offer real-world fixes, and connect folks who love turning theory into working circuits. Through RADIOFELLOWS, we hope to make RF design more approachable, more fun, and ultimately more innovative for all.
